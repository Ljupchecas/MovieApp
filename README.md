# MovieApp
Developed a robust Web API for movie-related functionalities, facilitating seamless access to movie data and management within web applications.

This application is a movie management system built using ASP.NET Core. It provides functionalities to manage movies, such as adding, updating, and deleting movies, as well as filtering them based on criteria like year and genre. The application utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, ensuring secure access to its endpoints. Additionally, it includes a User controller with functionalities for user registration and login, enhancing the overall user experience by allowing individuals to create accounts and authenticate themselves to access the movie management features. With its RESTful API architecture and integration of authentication mechanisms, this application offers a robust platform for managing and accessing movie data.

In addition to the above, it's worth mentioning that this application was developed while I was still learning and at a beginner level. Despite this, it serves as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to gain practical skills in ASP.NET Core development, RESTful API design, and JWT-based authentication. By building a movie management system, I had the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, honing my programming skills and understanding of web development concepts. While the application may not be perfect, it represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer and underscores my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
